# simple-video-player
A really simple Youtube video player built in jQuery without the Youtube API.

## Use cases

### 1. View list

* Create a Javascript object that contains an array of objects that will represent videos (video name, Youtube video ID, etc)
* Create functionality that will use this data to display a “list” of items. You won’t need an image (thumbnail) URL because you can get one by using the Youtube ID
